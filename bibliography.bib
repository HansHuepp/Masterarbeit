@article{Lu.2023,
 abstract = {Cross-chain interoperability can expand the ability of data interaction and value circulation between different blockchains, especially the value interaction and information sharing between industry consortium blockchains. However, some current public blockchain cross-chain technologies or data migration schemes between consortium blockchains need help to meet the consortium blockchain requirements for efficient two-way data interaction. The critical issue to solve in cross-chain technology is improving the efficiency of cross-chain exchange while ensuring the security of data transmission outside the consortium blockchain. In this article, we design a cross-chain architecture based on blockchain oracle technology. Then, we propose a bidirectional information cross-chain interaction approach (CCIO) based on the former architecture, we novelly improve three traditional blockchain oracle patterns, and we combine a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric keys to encrypt private information to ensure cross-chain data security. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CCIO approach can achieve efficient and secure two-way cross-chain data interactions and better meet the application needs of large-scale consortium blockchains.},

@article{Yao.2019,
 abstract = {To accelerate software development, much research has been performed to help people understand and reuse the huge amount of available code resources. Two important tasks have been widely studied: code retrieval, which aims to retrieve code snippets relevant to a given natural language query from a code base, and code annotation, where the goal is to annotate a code snippet with a natural language description. Despite their advancement in recent years, the two tasks are mostly explored separately. In this work, we investigate a novel perspective of Code annotation for Code retrieval (hence called `CoaCor'), where a code annotation model is trained to generate a natural language annotation that can represent the semantic meaning of a given code snippet and can be leveraged by a code retrieval model to better distinguish relevant code snippets from others. To this end, we propose an effective framework based on reinforcement learning, which explicitly encourages the code annotation model to generate annotations that can be used for the retrieval task. Through extensive experiments, we show that code annotations generated by our framework are much more detailed and more useful for code retrieval, and they can further improve the performance of existing code retrieval models significantly.},

abstract = {The purpose of a reputation system is to hold the users of a distributed application accountable for their behavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback because, for example, of fear of retaliation. Privacy-preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy-preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing approaches. Emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent significant development in the area. Blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation systems have properties, such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which prior systems do not have. Our analysis provides several insights and directions for future research. These include leveraging blockchain to its full potential in order to develop truly trustless systems, to achieve some important security properties, and to include defenses against common attacks that have so far not been addressed by most current systems.},

@article{Ghosh.2021,
 abstract = {With the increasing adoption of private blockchain platforms, consortia operating in various sectors such as trade, finance, logistics, etc., are becoming common. Despite having the benefits of a completely decentralized architecture which supports transparency and distributed control, existing private blockchains limit the data, assets, and processes within its closed boundary, which restricts secure and verifiable service provisioning to the end-consumers. Thus, platforms such as e-commerce with multiple sellers or cloud federation with a collection of cloud service providers cannot be decentralized with the existing blockchain platforms. This paper proposes a decentralized gateway architecture interfacing private blockchain with end-users by leveraging the unique combination of public and private blockchain platforms through interoperation. Through the use case of decentralized cloud federations, we have demonstrated the viability of the solution. Our testbed implementation with Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, with three service providers, shows that such consortium can operate within an acceptable response latency while scaling up to 64 parallel requests per second for cloud infrastructure provisioning. Further analysis over the Mininet emulation platform indicates that the platform can scale well with minimal impact over the latency as the number of participating service providers increases.},

Since a blockchain deals with its data in the form of transactions, the real technical question we want to answer is how to handle cross-blockchain transactions (CBTs)? We will first present the state-of-the-art systems, i.e., exchanging cryptocurrencies between Ethereum and Bitcoin, and discuss the challenges of extending existing approaches to a more general context, such as application-specific blockchains (instead of cryptocurrencies) and an arbitrary number of blockchains (instead of two). We then review two recent schools of thought about CBT protocols and discuss their properties in detail. Finally, we sketch an ongoing research effort on building a theoretical foundation for CBTs using topological machinery.",

 abstract = {Proof of work (PoW), the most popular consensus mechanism for Blockchain, requires ridiculously large amounts of energy but without any useful outcome beyond determining accounting rights among miners. To tackle the drawback of PoW, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus algorithm, namely proof of federated learning (PoFL), where the energy originally wasted to solve difficult but meaningless puzzles in PoW is reinvested to federated learning. Federated learning and pooled-ming, a trend of PoW, have a natural fit in terms of organization structure. However, the separation between the data usufruct and ownership in Blockchain lead to data privacy leakage in model training and verification, deviating from the original intention of federal learning. To address the challenge, a reverse game-based data trading mechanism and a privacy-preserving model verification mechanism are proposed. The former can guard against training data leakage while the latter verifies the accuracy of a trained model with privacy preservation of the task requester's test data as well as the pool's submitted model. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work to employ federal learning as the proof of work for Blockchain. Extensive simulations based on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanisms.},

@misc{Riel.2022,
 abstract = {Vernetzt, autonom, smart, elektrisch. Diese Schlagworte sind omnipr{\"a}sent in der Diskussion um Mobilit{\"a}t auf politischer, wissenschaftlicher und gesellschaftlicher Ebene. Tats{\"a}chlich scheinen enorme technologische Fortschritte in der n{\"a}chsten Zeit m{\"o}glich und Visionen von lebenswerten St{\"a}dten mit niederschwelligem Zugang zu einer nachhaltigen, umfeldvertr{\"a}glichen Mobilit{\"a}t erscheinen zum Greifen nahe.

In der Forschung und Entwicklung werden von der Fahrzeug- und Dienstleistungsindustrie {\"u}berwiegend Fragestellungen diskutiert, die sich entweder auf die technische Weiterentwicklung der Fahrzeuge und der Stra{\ss}eninfrastruktur oder auf die Entwicklung neuer Gesch{\"a}ftsmodelle im Zusammenhang mit dem autonomen Fahren beziehen. Beide Aktivit{\"a}ten zielen auf zus{\"a}tzliche Mobilit{\"a}tsoptionen f{\"u}r zus{\"a}tzliche Personengruppen ab. An diesem Punkt setzt das Forschungsprojekt {\glqq}Autonomes Fahren -- Risiken und Chancen f{\"u}r die St{\"a}dte{\grqq} (AutoRICH) an: AutoRICH nimmt Risiken in den Blick, die v.a. damit einhergehen, dass durch autonomes Fahren voraussichtlich Mehrverkehr generiert wird, der sowohl die Kommunen als auch die Stra{\ss}enbaulasttr{\"a}ger vor enorme Herausforderungen stellt. Diese werden den allseits diskutierten Chancen kritisch gegen{\"u}bergestellt.

Mit AutoRICH wird also die bislang stark anbieterseitige Perspektive erweitert: Mittels eines akteurszentrierten und interdisziplin{\"a}ren Ansatzes, der soziologische sowie verkehrs- und stadtplanerische Perspektiven aufeinander bezieht, wird zum einen danach gefragt, welche technischen, {\"o}konomischen und sozialen Chancen und Risiken aus der Perspektive der Kommune mit dem autonomen Fahren (AF) einhergehen. Zum anderen wird ber{\"u}cksichtigt, welche Bedeutung dem autonomen Fahren aus Sicht der Endverbraucher:innen zukommt. Vor dem Hintergrund eines solchen integrierten Ansatzes werden Rahmenbedingungen bzw. Steuerungsm{\"o}glichkeiten definiert, mittels derer das autonome Fahren den erhofften Beitrag zu einer nachhaltigen und stadtvertr{\"a}glichen Mobilit{\"a}t leisten kann bzw. negative Risiken f{\"u}r Kommune und Endverbraucher:innen abgewendet werden k{\"o}nnen.},

@misc{Knudsen.4142017,
 abstract = {Backwards analysis, first popularized by Seidel, is often the simplest most elegant way of analyzing a randomized algorithm. It applies to incremental algorithms where elements are added incrementally, following some random permutation, e.g., incremental Delauney triangulation of a pointset, where points are added one by one, and where we always maintain the Delauney triangulation of the points added thus far. For backwards analysis, we think of the permutation as generated backwards, implying that the $i$th point in the permutation is picked uniformly at random from the $i$ points not picked yet in the backwards direction. Backwards analysis has also been applied elegantly by Chan to the randomized linear time minimum spanning tree algorithm of Karger, Klein, and Tarjan.  The question considered in this paper is how much randomness we need in order to trust the expected bounds obtained using backwards analysis, exactly and approximately. For the exact case, it turns out that a random permutation works if and only if it is minwise, that is, for any given subset, each element has the same chance of being first. Minwise permutations are known to have {\$}$\backslash$Theta(n){\$} entropy, and this is then also what we need for exact backwards analysis.  However, when it comes to approximation, the two concepts diverge dramatically. To get backwards analysis to hold within a factor {\$}$\backslash$alpha{\$}, the random permutation needs entropy {\$}$\backslash$Omega(n/$\backslash$alpha){\$}. This contrasts with minwise permutations, where it is known that a {\$}1+$\backslash$varepsilon{\$} approximation only needs {\$}$\backslash$Theta(\log (n/$\backslash$varepsilon)){\$} entropy. Our negative result for backwards analysis essentially shows that it is as abstract as any analysis based on full randomness.},

@article{Gencer.2018,
 abstract = {Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have demonstrated how to securely implement traditionally centralized systems, such as currencies, in a decentralized fashion. However, there have been few measurement studies on the level of decentralization they achieve in practice. We present a measurement study on various decentralization metrics of two of the leading cryptocurrencies with the largest market capitalization and user base, Bitcoin and Ethereum. We investigate the extent of decentralization by measuring the network resources of nodes and the interconnection among them, the protocol requirements affecting the operation of nodes, and the robustness of the two systems against attacks. In particular, we adapted existing internet measurement techniques and used the Falcon Relay Network as a novel measurement tool to obtain our data. We discovered that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has strictly better properties than the other. We also provide concrete suggestions for improving both systems.

 abstract = {Federated learning has been a hot research topic in enabling the collaborative training of machine learning models among different organizations under the privacy restrictions. As researchers try to support more machine learning models with different privacy-preserving approaches, there is a requirement in developing systems and infrastructures to ease the development of various federated learning algorithms. Similar to deep learning systems such as PyTorch and TensorFlow that boost the development of deep learning, federated learning systems (FLSs) are equivalently important, and face challenges from various aspects such as effectiveness, efficiency, and privacy. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on federated learning systems. To achieve smooth flow and guide future research, we introduce the definition of federated learning systems and analyze the system components. Moreover, we provide a thorough categorization for federated learning systems according to six different aspects, including data distribution, machine learning model, privacy mechanism, communication architecture, scale of federation and motivation of federation. The categorization can help the design of federated learning systems as shown in our case studies. By systematically summarizing the existing federated learning systems, we present the design factors, case studies, and future research opportunities.
