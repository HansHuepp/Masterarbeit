@article{Lu.2023,
 abstract = {Cross-chain interoperability can expand the ability of data interaction and value circulation between different blockchains, especially the value interaction and information sharing between industry consortium blockchains. However, some current public blockchain cross-chain technologies or data migration schemes between consortium blockchains need help to meet the consortium blockchain requirements for efficient two-way data interaction. The critical issue to solve in cross-chain technology is improving the efficiency of cross-chain exchange while ensuring the security of data transmission outside the consortium blockchain. In this article, we design a cross-chain architecture based on blockchain oracle technology. Then, we propose a bidirectional information cross-chain interaction approach (CCIO) based on the former architecture, we novelly improve three traditional blockchain oracle patterns, and we combine a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric keys to encrypt private information to ensure cross-chain data security. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CCIO approach can achieve efficient and secure two-way cross-chain data interactions and better meet the application needs of large-scale consortium blockchains.},

@article{Ghosh.2021,
 abstract = {With the increasing adoption of private blockchain platforms, consortia operating in various sectors such as trade, finance, logistics, etc., are becoming common. Despite having the benefits of a completely decentralized architecture which supports transparency and distributed control, existing private blockchains limit the data, assets, and processes within its closed boundary, which restricts secure and verifiable service provisioning to the end-consumers. Thus, platforms such as e-commerce with multiple sellers or cloud federation with a collection of cloud service providers cannot be decentralized with the existing blockchain platforms. This paper proposes a decentralized gateway architecture interfacing private blockchain with end-users by leveraging the unique combination of public and private blockchain platforms through interoperation. Through the use case of decentralized cloud federations, we have demonstrated the viability of the solution. Our testbed implementation with Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, with three service providers, shows that such consortium can operate within an acceptable response latency while scaling up to 64 parallel requests per second for cloud infrastructure provisioning. Further analysis over the Mininet emulation platform indicates that the platform can scale well with minimal impact over the latency as the number of participating service providers increases.},

@misc{Qu.12262019,
 abstract = {Proof of work (PoW), the most popular consensus mechanism for Blockchain, requires ridiculously large amounts of energy but without any useful outcome beyond determining accounting rights among miners. To tackle the drawback of PoW, we propose a novel energy-recycling consensus algorithm, namely proof of federated learning (PoFL), where the energy originally wasted to solve difficult but meaningless puzzles in PoW is reinvested to federated learning. Federated learning and pooled-ming, a trend of PoW, have a natural fit in terms of organization structure. However, the separation between the data usufruct and ownership in Blockchain lead to data privacy leakage in model training and verification, deviating from the original intention of federal learning. To address the challenge, a reverse game-based data trading mechanism and a privacy-preserving model verification mechanism are proposed. The former can guard against training data leakage while the latter verifies the accuracy of a trained model with privacy preservation of the task requester's test data as well as the pool's submitted model. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work to employ federal learning as the proof of work for Blockchain. Extensive simulations based on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanisms.},

@article{Gencer.2018,
 abstract = {Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have demonstrated how to securely implement traditionally centralized systems, such as currencies, in a decentralized fashion. However, there have been few measurement studies on the level of decentralization they achieve in practice. We present a measurement study on various decentralization metrics of two of the leading cryptocurrencies with the largest market capitalization and user base, Bitcoin and Ethereum. We investigate the extent of decentralization by measuring the network resources of nodes and the interconnection among them, the protocol requirements affecting the operation of nodes, and the robustness of the two systems against attacks. In particular, we adapted existing internet measurement techniques and used the Falcon Relay Network as a novel measurement tool to obtain our data. We discovered that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum has strictly better properties than the other. We also provide concrete suggestions for improving both systems.
