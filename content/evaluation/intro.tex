After designing the GETACAR platform and developing a prototype based on this design it is important to evaluate the platform to prove its viability. To do so we will validate the GETACAR platform against the objects defined at the beginning of this research in section \ref{sec:objectives}. Afterwards, we will conduct a final privacy assessment of the platform and the prototype to ensure that we meet all privacy goals. At last, we will showcase the results from testing the completed GETACAR prototype.
