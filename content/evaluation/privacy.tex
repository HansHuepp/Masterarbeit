User anonymity-oriented privacy-preserving reputation systems. The true identity of the users is hidden in these systems. The feedback providers thus remain anonymous. A user is represented in the system by one or more pseudonyms which are unlinkable to her real identity. This setup allows the user to anonymously carry out transactions with others and submit feedback. The submitted feedback does not need to be confidential since the anonymity of the users prevents the feedback from being linked to them.
