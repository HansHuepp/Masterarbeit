\textbf{Prototypical Realization of the Decentralized Platform}

One of the main goals of this research is to proof that the creation of a decentralized, feature complete platform for ride-pooling is feasible.  The feasibility will be proven in two steps:

1. Conceptualization: Before diving into implementation, this research will cover the theoretical design of the framework for the platform. This involves establishing a general vision of the platform, mapping out user flows, and ensuring the platform's privacy considerations and robustness against potential threats.

2. Prototyping: Based on the theoretical design, we will proceed to design and afterwards construct a prototype of the platform. By building the platform,  we can simulate real-world scenarios, understand unforeseen challenges, and refine the design in response to these challenges.


\textbf{Design of an Interaction Protocol between the Platform, Users, and Providers}

The platform, at its core, is an ecosystem of interaction flows.  A streamlined, secure, and efficient protocol for these interactions is necessary for the success of the platform. The objective here is to develop an interaction flow that: Ensures Seamless ride booking, facilitates trustworthy transactions and preserves privacy.


\textbf{Design of a Trust Mechanism for Users and Providers}

Trust is a necessity for any successful platform. In decentralized systems, where there is not a central authority to manage disputes or verify participants, the importance of trust is high. The objective is to instate mechanisms that: verifies participants, incentives good behavior and penalize misconduct.


\textbf{Evaluation of User and Provider Anonymity in Transactions}

An integral part of the platform's advantage is the security that users and providers can have transaction with each other without directly knowing each other's identity. This objective involves:
Showing how the platform hides the identities of participants during transactions and insuring that no party is able to collect critical amounts of data.


\textbf{Proposal of Solutions for Physical Issues and Edge Cases}

While much of the research focuses on the digital side of the platform, the handling of unpredictable issues that accrue in the real-world can not be ignored. Prominent concerns in ride-pooling, especially with autonomous vehicles, are the potential damage to vehicles by passengers or inappropriate actions by individuals towards other passengers. Therefor, the aim is to: Ensure accountability and conceptualise reporting mechanisms.
