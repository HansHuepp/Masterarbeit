With autonomous vehicles becoming a reality in the near future, an increase in overall traffic on the roads can be expected. The mass utilisation of ride-pooling platforms can counter this development, but the current ride-pooling platforms are built centralised and are lacklustre in regards to data privacy. Therefore, this research aims to create a decentralised, privacy-preserving ride-pooling platform that provides a feasible alternative to the current platform landscape.
