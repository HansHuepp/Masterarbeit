Addressing the complexities inherent in the development and implementation of a decentralized ride-pooling platform makes a structured, systematic approach necessary. The methodology, informed by best practices in research and technological development, is comprised of a series of stages, each building upon the previous, to ensure the project's integrity and viability. This section describes the steps it will take to accomplish the research objectives and to answer the research questions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Literature Research about Current Solutions}: 
    The first step is immersing ourselves in the wealth of knowledge that already exists. We'll review academic papers, industry reports, and whitepapers pertinent to autonomous driving, ride-pooling, decentralized systems, and related technologies. This phase will provide a grounding, offering insights into what has been achieved, the methodologies employed by other researchers, and where gaps or opportunities might lie. The literature review will also aid in benchmarking, setting standards against which we can measure our own solutions.

    \item \textbf{Identification of Shortcomings}: 
    Building on the knowledge acquired in the literature review, we will undertake a critical analysis to identify shortcomings, limitations, or unaddressed issues in existing solutions. This could range from technological challenges to concerns about privacy, scalability, user adoption, and more. Highlighting these gaps will provide a clear direction for our proposed solution and ensure that our platform offers tangible improvements over existing models.

    \item \textbf{Proposal of a Solution Design}:
    With a comprehensive understanding of the landscape and the identified gaps, we'll move to the design phase. This involves conceptualizing the architecture of the decentralized platform, defining interaction protocols, and outlining trust mechanisms, among other components. Detailed flowcharts, system diagrams, and user journey maps are developed during this phase to visualize and refine the design.

    \item \textbf{Prototypical Implementation of the Solution Design}: 
    Once the design is solidified, the next step is to build a prototype. This phase involves actual coding, leveraging technologies like Ethereum and developing smart contracts, user interfaces, matching services, and more. The prototype serves as a tangible representation of the design, allowing for real-world testing and iterative refinement.

    \item \textbf{Evaluation Whether the Previously Set Requirements Are Met}: 
    Post-implementation, the evaluation phase starts. The prototype will be assessed against the requirements and objectives set for this research. This evaluation involves functional testing, ensuring the system operates as intended, as well as non-functional testing, which involve assessments of scalability, performance, and privacy preservation. <Feedback from Users and other Stakeholders possible>

    \item \textbf{Identification of Limitations and Proposal of Possible Improvements}:
After evaluating the prototype, I will identify any potential shortcomings, challenges, or areas for enhancement. Based on this, I will propose possible improvements, setting the stage for subsequent iterations or future research endeavors.
\end{enumerate}

In summary, this iterative methodology insures both an in depth academic research and proceeding while still accounting for the needs of a real-world application. By progressing systematically through these stages, the aim is to develop a decentralized ride-pooling platform that utilises state of the art technologies and architecture to respond to real-world challenges and needs.
