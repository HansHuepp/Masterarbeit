\toprule
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Pros} & \textbf{Cons} \\
\midrule
Decentralization &  Eliminates the need for a central third party. &  Vulnerable to malicious users exploiting the anonymity of the blockchain. \\
\midrule
Privacy &  Users can determine ridesharing possibilities while preserving trip data. &  Requires complex protocols (like zeroknowledge set membership proof) to ensure privacy. \\
\midrule
Security &  Timelocked deposit protocol ensures commitment from both drivers and riders. &  Malicious users might submit multiple ride requests/offers without commitment, potentially disrupting service. \\
\midrule
Payment System &  "Payasyoudrive" ensures fair payment based on actual distance covered. &  Requires users to be familiar with blockchainbased payment systems, which might be a learning curve for some. \\
\midrule
Reputation System &  Rates drivers based on past behavior, promoting trust and reliability. &  New drivers without a history might find it challenging to get initial rides. \\
\midrule
Implementation on Blockchain &  Operates on a public blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability. &  Associated with gas costs and challenges related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. \\
\midrule
Service Fees &  Potentially lower service fees as there's no central entity taking a significant cut. &  Transaction fees (gas costs) associated with blockchain operations might apply. \\
\midrule
Resilience &  Not prone to single points of failure typical of centralized systems. &  The decentralized nature might make dispute resolution or customer service more challenging. \\
\midrule
Transparency &  All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency. &  Balancing transparency with privacy can be challenging. \\
\midrule
User Adoption &  Can attract users who prefer decentralized, transparent, and private platforms. &  Requires users to understand and trust blockchain technology, which might be a barrier for mainstream adoption. \\
